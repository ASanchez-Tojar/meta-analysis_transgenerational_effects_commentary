# Meta-analysis of adaptive "transgenerational" effects: a commentary on [Yin et al. (2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.13373), Ecology Letters.

This project contains the materials for a project testing the generality and robustness of adaptive "transgenerational" effects across species, environments... It re-analyzes a published meta-analytic data set to show that adaptive "transgenerational" effects - more specifically, anticipatory parental effects, despite existing in some species, are not as widespread as generally believe.

This repository contains the data and Rmarkdown code used in the following study:

Alfredo Sánchez-Tójar, Malgorzata Lagisz, Nicholas P. Moran, Shinichi Nakagawa, Daniel W. A. Noble, Klaus Reinhold. *In preparation*. The jury is still out regarding the generality of adaptive “transgenerational” effects.
